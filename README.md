# JavaStack

Let's talk about dynamic data structures.  
Def<sup>n</sup>: A **linked list** is a data structure that can grow dynamically. Each element of a linked list has a value and a pointer that points to the next element. Unlike an array, it does not allow random access.  

Def<sup>n</sup>: A **stack** is a list such that the last in element is the first out - like a stack of paper (this is much easier to implement this than it is to implement queue).  
Def<sup>n</sup>: A **queue** is a list such that the first in element is the first out - like a queue of people. We call the front of the queue "head", and the end of the queue "tail".  

Def<sup>n</sup>: A linked data structure can be organised in the form of a **binary tree**, ie. each element (item) stores a value and has at most 3 pointers - left, right, and parent, where they point to the left child, right child, and parent respectively.  
Observe that only the root's parent is null and both children of each and every leaf are null.
